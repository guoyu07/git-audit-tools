# git-pullrequests

## What?
git-pullrequests is a simple ruby command line utility to retrieve the closed pull requests, and associated commits, for a specified repository, file (optional), and date range.  The results are saved to a PDF.
## Why?
A lot of compliance assessment relevant information is retained in pull requests.  During a recent assessment an individual had to manually load and PDF print the details of each pull request for review.  Tedious, unnecessary work well suited for a script.
